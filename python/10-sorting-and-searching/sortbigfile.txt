"Imagine you have a 20 GB file with one string per line. Explain how you would
sort the file."

20 GB is too large to fit in memory. We need to sort chunk by chunk. Choose an
algorithm with good asymptotics to sort, say in 1.25GB chunks. Then we can
merge each of these without having to read the whole of the chunk - we can open
a file stream and read line-by-line, and write them to the correct, new
location, perhaps in 1.25GB memory chunks. We could do this in-place if needed.
